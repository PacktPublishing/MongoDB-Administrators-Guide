# MongoDB Administrator’s Guide
This is the code repository for [MongoDB Administrator’s Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mongodb-administrator’s-guide?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787126480), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
MongoDB is a high-performance and feature-rich NoSQL database that forms the backbone of the systems that power many different organizations. Packed with many features that have become essential for many different types of software professional and incredibly easy to use, this cookbook contains more than 100 recipes to address the everyday challenges of working with MongoDB.

Starting with database configuration, you will understand the indexing aspects of MongoDB. The book also includes practical recipes on how you can optimize your database query performance, perform diagnostics, and query debugging. You will also learn how to implement the core administration tasks required for high-availability and scalability, achieved through replica sets and sharding, respectively. You will also implement server security concepts such as authentication, user management, role-based access models, and TLS configuration. You will also learn how to back up and recover your database efficiently and monitor server performance

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
PATH=~/data/mongodb/bin:${PATH}
export PATH
```

For the most part, this book requires only MongoDB 3.4 or higher. Although most of the
operating system commands used throughout the book are for Linux, the semantics is
generic and can be replayed on any operating system. It may be useful to have some
knowledge of how MongoDB works, but for the most part, all chapters are verbose enough
for beginners as well.
